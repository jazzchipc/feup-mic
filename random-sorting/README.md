# random-sorting

> The goal of this assignment is to understand how important it is to systematize the process of writing scientific papers.
>
> For that purpose, you will first write a short, simple paper (the topic is defined below) at the beginning of the course. Later, after learning about research methodologies, you will read it again in light of your newly acquired skills.
>
> The title of the paper will be "Random Sorting: Why not?" (may be a different one, if you can come up with something cooler) and the goal is to convince the reader that the random sorting algorithm does not work. The random sorting algorithm can be described as: given a vector of numbers, shuffle them randomly with the goal of ordering them in ascending/descending order.
>
> The paper should be written by groups of 2 students and have at most 2 pages.
